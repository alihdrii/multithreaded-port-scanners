# Multithreaded Port Scanners
This repository contains the source code for some **Multithreaded Port Scanners** written in different programming languages in the standalone source files.

- [Scala](https://github.com/rezzzza/multithreaded-port-scanners/tree/master/scala)
- Java
- [Python](https://github.com/rezzzza/multithreaded-port-scanners/tree/master/python)
- Ruby
- PHP
- ...

#### Why we develop the Port Scanner in the different languages?
We will use this codes to:

- compare the implementation of the **Threads** in this languages
- provide a standard to measuring the performance and efficiency of these languages


## Using

There is a README in the section of each programming language.
